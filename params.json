{"name":"Hotbit","tagline":"ASE density-functional tight-binding calculator","body":"### Welcome to the GitHub Pages of the Hotbit code\r\nHotbit is a native density-functional tight-binding calculator for python's atomic simulation environment ([ASE](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/)).\r\n\r\n### Hotbit philosophy\r\nHotbit aims to provide\r\n* an open-source DFTB code\r\n* a companion for DFT,\r\n  * for easy & fast electronic structure analysis\r\n  * to access to dynamical properties\r\n  * to investigate systems of same size\r\n  * for testing, playing around \r\n* a compact and accessible code for everyone to inspect and modify\r\n  * trying to avoid parallelization, which implies that the code is less suitable for large systems\r\n* an intuitive user interface\r\n  * ideal for learning and teaching realistic electronic structure simulations \r\n\r\n## UNDER CONSTRUCTION\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/pages) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and we’ll help you sort it out.\r\n","google":"UA-71270515-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
